  "Therapeutic Class": "CARDIAC",
  "Action Class": "Beta blocker- Non selective",
  "How It Works": "Betacap TR 40 Capsule contains Propranolol, a beta blocker. It works by affecting the body’s response to nerve impulses, especially in the heart. It slows down your heart rate and makes it easier for the heart to pump blood around the body. This prevents arrhythmias. It also widens the blood vessels in the body for better blood flow, thereby preventing angina as well as migraine. The exact mechanism by which it prevents tremors is not known, but experts believe that Betacap TR 40 Capsule helps block the nerve impulses to the muscles responsible for tremors. Propranolol helps block the effects of the chemical messengers namely, adrenaline and noradrenaline, that are produced by the brain and are responsible for increasing your heart rate which makes you feel anxious. This way it helps with anxiety. While treating pheochromocytoma, Betacap TR 40 Capsule may be given to block the action of high-adrenaline hormones, to lower the risk of developing dangerously high blood pressure during surgery for removing the tumor."

  "How It Works": "Betacap TR 20 Capsule contains Propranolol, a beta blocker. It works by affecting the body’s response to nerve impulses, especially in the heart. It slows down your heart rate and makes it easier for the heart to pump blood around the body. This prevents arrhythmias. It also widens the blood vessels in the body for better blood flow, thereby preventing angina as well as migraine. The exact mechanism by which it prevents tremors is not known, but experts believe that Betacap TR 20 Capsule helps block the nerve impulses to the muscles responsible for tremors. Propranolol helps block the effects of the chemical messengers namely, adrenaline and noradrenaline, that are produced by the brain and are responsible for increasing your heart rate which makes you feel anxious. This way it helps with anxiety. While treating pheochromocytoma, Betacap TR 20 Capsule may be given to block the action of high-adrenaline hormones, to lower the risk of developing dangerously high blood pressure during surgery for removing the tumor."

The exact mechanism by which it prevents tremors is not known, but experts believe that Ciplar-LA 20 Tablet helps block the nerve impulses to the muscles responsible for tremors. Propranolol helps block the effects of the chemical messengers namely, adrenaline and noradrenaline, that are produced by the brain and are responsible for increasing your heart rate which makes you feel anxious. This way it helps with anxiety. While treating pheochromocytoma, Ciplar-LA 20 Tablet may be given to block the action of high-adrenaline hormones, to lower the risk of developing dangerously high blood pressure during surgery for removing the tumor."

  "How It Works": "Betacap 20 Tablet contains Propranolol, a beta blocker. It works by affecting the body’s response to nerve impulses, especially in the heart. It slows down your heart rate and makes it easier for the heart to pump blood around the body. This prevents arrhythmias. It also widens the blood vessels in the body for better blood flow, thereby preventing angina as well as migraine. The exact mechanism by which it prevents tremors is not known, but experts believe that Betacap 20 Tablet helps block the nerve impulses to the muscles responsible for tremors. Propranolol helps block the effects of the chemical messengers namely, adrenaline and noradrenaline, that are produced by the brain and are responsible for increasing your heart rate which makes you feel anxious. This way it helps with anxiety. While treating pheochromocytoma, Betacap 20 Tablet may be given to block the action of high-adrenaline hormones, to lower the risk of developing dangerously high blood pressure during surgery for removing the tumor."

  "Action Class": "Beta blocker- Non selective",
  "How It Works": "Inderal LA 20 Tablet SR contains Propranolol, a beta blocker. It works by affecting the body’s response to nerve impulses, especially in the heart. It slows down your heart rate and makes it easier for the heart to pump blood around the body. This prevents arrhythmias. It also widens the blood vessels in the body for better blood flow, thereby preventing angina as well as migraine. The exact mechanism by which it prevents tremors is not known, but experts believe that Inderal LA 20 Tablet SR helps block the nerve impulses to the muscles responsible for tremors. Propranolol helps block the effects of the chemical messengers namely, adrenaline and noradrenaline, that are produced by the brain and are responsible for increasing your heart rate which makes you feel anxious. This way it helps with anxiety. While treating pheochromocytoma, Inderal LA 20 Tablet SR may be given to block the action of high-adrenaline hormones, to lower the risk of developing dangerously high blood pressure during surgery for removing the tumor."
